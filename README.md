## Geoscience Data Quality Analysis

This project focuses on validating, cleaning, and assessing the quality of multi-source geoscience datasets used in exploration and project planning.

### Objectives
- Validate drilling, sampling, and assay datasets
- Identify data integrity issues such as gaps, orphan records, and inconsistencies
- Ensure datasets are reliable for downstream geoscience analysis

### Project Structure
- Phase 1: Data validation and cleaning
- Phase 2: Data quality assessment and integrity checks

### Tools
Python, pandas, SQL-style logic, and exploratory data validation techniques
